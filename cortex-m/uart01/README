The cortex-m series are thumb only machines, they cannot execute ARM
instructions.  They also boot a little differently instead of on reset
starting "execution" from address 0x00000000 they have a vector table
at address 0x00000000, which contains addresses to the entry points
depending on the exception.  The address for reset is found at address
0x00000004.

The lm3s811 is a cortex-m3 chip which is ARMv7m based so supports like
150 thumb2 extensions (variable length instructions).  Where the
cortex-m0 is ARMv6m based and only has like a dozen.  Going with the
cortex-m0 or even better the ARMv4T or arm7tdmi thumb instructions is
the most portable.  So demonstrated with that here even though the
lm3s811 can support thumb2 extensions.
